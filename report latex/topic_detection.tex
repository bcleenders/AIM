\section{Topic detection}
\textbf{Stuff we must include:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why K=1000 (long period of time, clusters seemed reasonable)
\item Why unsupervised (avoid bias choosing topics)
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:topic_detection}
It's data reduction and clustering, really...

Say that we did two types of unsupervised clustering: k-means and LDA. K-means

\subsection{Latent Dirichlet Allocation}
Some explanation what the F this is

\subsection{Word2Vec \& K-Means}
Explain two steps and how awesome it worked
