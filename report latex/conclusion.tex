\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this research was to find out how the popularity of topics on Hacker News evolves over time. To answer this question, we defined a measure of popularity based on the number of articles, number of upvotes and number of comments.

We then continued by dividing the dataset 1.5 million articles into topics using two unsupervised clustering algorithms: Word2Vec in combination with k-means and Latent Dirichlet allocation.
